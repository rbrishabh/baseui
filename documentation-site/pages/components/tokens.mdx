# Tokens

You can import Base Web design tokens from `baseui/tokens`. The idea of a "design token" originates with the [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/). Here is how they describe it in their documentation:

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

Currently we only export colors from `baseui/tokens`. In the future, we may add more types of values into the module or move it into a separate package to support other platforms.

## Colors

<div
  style={{
    fontFamily: 'Consolas, Monaco, "Andale Mono", "Ubuntu Mono", monospace',
    fontSize: 14,
    lineHeight: 1,
  }}
>
  {Object.entries(TokenExports.colors).map(([name, value]) => (
    <div
      style={{
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        borderBottom: `solid 1px ${value}`,
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          backgroundColor: value,
          width: 100,
          height: 50,
          marginRight: 20,
        }}
      ></div>
      <div style={{flexGrow: 1}}>{name}</div>
      <div>{value}</div>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>

Ideally these are the only colors you would use in a Base Web project. Note, that not every color is used in a component. This is simply the complete set of Base colors.

## Examples

<Example title="Importing and styling" path="tokens/basic.js">
  <BasicExample />
</Example>

You can import the module and use a token directly, either when styling a component or setting up your theme. This works fine because tokens do not change at run-time (and hopefully not often in general).

Some teams may decide to alias tokens on their theme object for slightly easier access when styling components. Here is how that might look in pseudo-code, adapting the above example:

```js
// theme setup...
import {createTheme, lightThemePrimitives} from 'baseui';
import {colors as colorTokens} from 'baseui/tokens';

export default createTheme(lightThemePrimitives, {
  colors: {
    ...colorTokens,
  },
});

// some component later on...
import React from 'react';
import {useStyletron} from 'baseui';

export default () => {
  const [useCss, theme] = useStyletron();
  return (
    <div className={useCss({color: theme.colors.blue400})}>
      This text is Uber blue!
    </div>
  );
};
```

We don't recommend this pattern, however. In our projects, we prefer to acknowledge the static nature of a design token and just import it where ever it is needed.

The theme layer is intended more for assigning values semantic meaning, such as `borderFocus` or `primary`. Also, keep in mind that adding lots of properties to the theme object may harm performance. For more on theming check out [the documentation](/guides/theming).
